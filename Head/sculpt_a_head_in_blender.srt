1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.500 
In this video we'll be sculpting a human
head from scratch.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.200 
We'll start with a UV sphere and then
turning it step by step into a human

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.940 
head, going over all the steps that you
need to know to create a human head.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.640 
We'll start off simple by first creating
the rough shape of a head from a UV sphere.

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.360 
We'll then start adding bit by bit all of
the facial elements to this sphere.

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.200 
We'll spend quite a bit of time at this
low resolution putting all the facial

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.980 
elements before then increasing the
resolution and adding some more

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.240 
definition to these shapes.

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.980 
Once we've done that we'll start dialing

10
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.320 
in all of these facial features to work together.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.120 
Once we're done with the face we'll focus

12
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.100 
on the ears as well as the neck.

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.960 
And once we've done all that you'll have

14
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.620 
all the foundation to create interesting
heads and faces.

15
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.380 
Now I'm going to go over the assumption
that you know your way around the

16
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.320 
sculpting tools in Blender but if you
don't go check out Zach's course on 3D

17
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.360 
sculpting in Blender.

18
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.860 
It's a comprehensive course that will

19
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.620 
teach you all the basics as well as some
advanced techniques on how to sculpt in Blender.

20
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.440 
So now with that out of the way let's
jump into Blender.

21
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.800 
Hey hey so here we are in Blender.

22
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.880 
So to start off let's select all of our

23
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.340 
objects over here and let's delete these.

24
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.500 
We won't be needing these and let's add

25
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.660 
in a UV sphere.

26
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.580 
We'll be using this to sculpt our head.

27
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.280 
So now with our UV sphere added let's go
to the sculpting tab over here on the top.

28
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.040 
This will set the layout for Blender more
oriented towards sculpting and in fact

29
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.520 
we're already in sculpting mode as you
can see over here.

30
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.780 
Now in the 3D viewport I'm going to
adjust the tool panel.

31
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.840 
I'm just going to drag it out just a bit
just so we have two icons.

32
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
Not so far that all the names pop up just
far enough that we have these two rows of icons.

33
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.240 
This will help you see which tools I'm
using when we start sculpting our head.

34
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.900 
Now in this video we're going to
primarily focus on the base shapes for

35
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.300 
the head.

36
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.520 
So we're going to work in symmetry.

37
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.640 
So for this let's enable X symmetry.

38
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.580 
So up here let's enable X symmetry.

39
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.900 
And now with this if we make any changes
to our model over here

40
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.080 
.

41
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.660 
So with our grab brush you can make any

42
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.800 
changes like so.

43
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.080 
The same will happen on the other side

44
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.520 
along the X axis.

45
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.040 
Now before we start sculpting anything

46
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's important to have references.

47
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.980 
So I'm going to drag in my reference window.

48
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.200 
So for this I'm using PureRef.

49
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.620 
This is a very handy program.

50
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.820 
This allows me to have all my references
up here on top of Blender or whatever

51
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.580 
software I'm using.

52
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.780 
So I can easily modify anything within

53
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.400 
the software and then have all of my
references over here on top.

54
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.240 
So this makes it very easy to use
reference material when sculpting in Blender.

55
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.300 
Now we don't just have this window over here.

56
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.040 
We can move it whenever we want by

57
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.260 
holding right click.

58
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.920 
So if it's obstructing something we can

59
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.160 
easily move it out of the way.

60
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.780 
And then when we're done we can move it

61
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.980 
back just like so.

62
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.760 
Now to manipulate things within PureRef

63
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.020 
we can simply use the scroll wheel to
zoom in.

64
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.420 
Hold the middle mouse button to move around.

65
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.800 
And we can just use click and drag to

66
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.160 
modify what's inside.

67
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.000 
So having PureRef is really handy

68
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.240 
especially if you only have one screen.

69
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520 
So you can have your references right there.

70
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.240 
But even if you have multiple screens I
still recommend using PureRef right on

71
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.160 
top of Blender.

72
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.940 
So you have this reference right next to

73
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.840 
where you're working.

74
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.460 
It really helps having something that

75
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.620 
close by hand.

76
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.560 
That said I have a second window open on

77
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.720 
my second screen where I have a lot of
references as well.

78
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.700 
So having as much reference as possible
is always good.

79
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
Since no artist can work well just based
on muscle memory.

80
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.840 
Having something to use as a reference.

81
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.800 
Something to work off.

82
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.340 
Something to guide your decisions is
always better.

83
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.500 
So get as many references as you can.

84
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.560 
So now with that let's get started

85
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.540 
sculpting the head.

86
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.080 
So what we're going to do to start off is

87
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.580 
just to create the base rough shape for
the head.

88
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.980 
So we're just trying to get this upside
down egg shape as it were.

89
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.700 
Just from the front view over here.

90
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.580 
Pushing this in using our grab brush.

91
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.380 
Just adjusting this shape.

92
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.960 
Now from the side view what we're going

93
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.320 
to do.

94
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.900 
We're going to try to get the shape that

95
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.000 
we can see over here.

96
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.700 
So I'm just going to drag this in over here.

97
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.080 
Let's push this up as well.

98
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.460 
So we have this chin area over here.

99
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.680 
And the back of the skull over here.

100
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.120 
Just adjusting the shape like so.

101
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.520 
Again using the grab brush just to get
that rough shape.

102
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.200 
Now next up we want to create the neck.

103
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
So for this we can use the mask tool.

104
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.820 
Let's mask out this area over here at the bottom.

105
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.660 
Let's invert our mask.

106
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.580 
Now just drag this down to create the neck.

107
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.280 
Now the geometry is warping a lot since

108
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.040 
we're working at low resolution.

109
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.620 
But this is fine.

110
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.760 
We just want to create the rough shape
for the neck.

111
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.520 
So let's just adjust this with our grab brush.

112
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.760 
Just so we get a rough approximation of

113
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.300 
what our neck will look like.

114
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.360 
We can now undo our mask.

115
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.860 
We can now adjust the shape of the head.

116
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.960 
Again let's look at our reference over here.

117
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.520 
Just adjust the shape of the head over here.

118
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.140 
To fit towards this new neck that we just added.

119
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.800 
So let's just adjust some of this
geometry over here.

120
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.680 
Just using the grab brush just to adjust
the silhouette of our head over here.

121
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.480 
Now once we're happy with the rough shape
of our head.

122
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.860 
We can use the voxel remesher to remesh
our mesh.

123
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.240 
To add a bit more geometry to work with.

124
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.040 
So let's press R.

125
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.840 
Let's set the resolution to something
like 0 .05.

126
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.720 
Let's now press CTRL R to apply the voxel remesh.

127
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.400 
So just like that we added all of this

128
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.980 
new geometry to our mesh.

129
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.640 
Let's now hold SHIFT just to smooth out

130
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.520 
all of this geometry.

131
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.640 
Just so we have a nice clean base to work from.

132
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.540 
So now with that all smoothed out we have
a nice base over here.

133
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.020 
Let's just use this grab brush just to
bring out this neck over here.

134
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.620 
Just a bit more.

135
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.180 
Let's now start bringing out some of

136
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.300 
these facial features.

137
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.460 
So some of these landmarks.

138
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.280 
So for this let's get our crease brush.

139
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.040 
And let's reduce the pinch value.

140
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.920 
As I don't want to pinch any of the
geometry together just yet.

141
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.100 
And let's start bringing out some of
these features.

142
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.740 
So let's increase the strength.

143
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.020 
And let's start bringing out some of

144
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.620 
these shapes.

145
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.860 
Over here let's bring out this jaw shape.

146
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.580 
So hold CTRL just to bring out this jaw
line over here.

147
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.040 
Now just trying to bring out landmarks.

148
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.200 
So we don't want to be too focused on

149
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.760 
getting these shapes right just now.

150
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.860 
We just want to get these landmarks.

151
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.480 
So let's for example bring in these eye sockets.

152
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.320 
So let's push this in over here.

153
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.480 
Let's just play fast and loose with these shapes.

154
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.800 
We just want to start getting a feel for

155
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.020 
some of these landmarks.

156
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.500 
These base shapes.

157
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.700 
So let's start bringing out this nose as well.

158
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.140 
Again just very simple.

159
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.200 
And here the mouth.

160
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.920 
So just push this area in just for the mouth.

161
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.700 
Let's push out where the actual mouth
would be like so.

162
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.480 
Now use the grab brush just to adjust the
profile, the silhouette of these shapes.

163
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.180 
Again we're just trying to very slowly
but surely bring out some of these very

164
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.080 
simple base shapes.

165
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.160 
Again let's make sure we're using our

166
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.320 
reference while we make these adjustments.

167
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.100 
So let's for example push in this ridge

168
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.140 
that we can see over here from the skull.

169
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.240 
So let's use our crease brush once again.

170
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.100 
Let's just push in this area over here.

171
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.040 
Let's bring out the brow as well.

172
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.520 
Let's also separate the forehead a bit
like so.

173
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.920 
I think also going to bring out the
cheekbone over here.

174
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.300 
And again let's drag out the shape of the jaw.

175
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.840 
So we're just you know playing fast and

176
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.620 
loose with the shapes.

177
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.120 
Just trying to bring out all of these landmarks.

178
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.880 
So over here at the side I think I'm
going to bring out the ear over here.

179
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.540 
Just behind the jaw
.

180
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.040 
So let's drag out this shape over here.

181
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.540 
Let's now get our grab brush just to

182
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.740 
adjust the shape over here.

183
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.880 
So I'm going to bring this lower part

184
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.340 
down just a bit more.

185
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.500 
And then push back the ends of our ear.

186
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
Now that we're here we can also adjust
the silhouette of the forehead over here.

187
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.440 
As well as the mouth area.

188
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.560 
Now to guide us we can use this reference

189
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.600 
material of this skull over here to guide
these shapes.

190
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.580 
So if we line up the camera to our
reference we can already tell that our

191
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.280 
mouth is way too far forwards.

192
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
So let's use our grab brush just to push

193
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.400 
this back a little.

194
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.360 
Next thing I notice is that we have this

195
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.320 
clear separation between the nose bridge
and the brow so let's adjust this as well

196
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.360 
We can also see we have this clear
protrusion of the chin so let's drag this

197
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.020 
chin out a bit.

198
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.780 
Let's use our grab brush just to pull

199
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.960 
this out just a bit more
And we can also tell the shape of the jaw

200
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.360 
needs to be adjusted as well.

201
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.300 
So let's use our grab brush just to

202
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.540 
adjust the shape of the jaw.

203
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.380 
Now we don't want to just focus on the

204
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.840 
facial features We also want to make sure
that the shape of the head is correct.

205
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.980 
So let's make sure that the like of the
head over here Follows the same shape

206
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.740 
that we can see in our reference material
So in this stage, you're basically just

207
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.760 
adjusting all of these areas to follow
more or less the shape

208
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.940 
that we can see in our reference
So we're just focusing on these big shapes.

209
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.380 
We're ignoring any of these smaller
details We're just trying to get all of

210
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.720 
these bigger shapes in place So once
we're happy with the structural changes

211
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.040 
based on the skull we can move on to
different references just to keep

212
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.580 
building on To these shapes for example
over here.

213
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.880 
We can tell that we can make our chin a
whole lot wider We can see this rounder shape.

214
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.540 
So let's just adjust this with our grab
brush We also see that the location of

215
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.780 
the ears need to be shifted down a bit.

216
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.780 
So let's get our ears and just direct

217
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.620 
these Down just a tad.

218
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.360 
I'm gonna just make some minor tweaks

219
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:44.780 
over here.

220
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.200 
For example, the tip of the nose We can

221
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.760 
push this down a bit.

222
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.660 
So just some of the cheeks again Just

223
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.720 
looking at the reference and then just
making these small changes Now when it

224
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.340 
comes to making these head sculpts for
me, I like to bring out a bit more of the

225
00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.240 
base of the neck
So I like to bring out the trapezius from

226
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.460 
the back over here of the neck Now when
it comes to the front, I like to bring it

227
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.920 
all the way down to where I would imagine
the clavicle being So we're keeping these

228
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.920 
shapes are very simple.

229
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.840 
Just like we did with the rest of the

230
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.620 
head now I think we need to move the base
of the neck down a bit.

231
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:18.100 
So for this let's use the box select tool
Let's select this lower area over here

232
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.920 
Let's press M to get our mask tool and
it's smooth out the transition of this

233
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.800 
mask Now press ctrl I to invert this mask
and let's use the move tool just to move

234
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.720 
this base of the neck down a bit
So just like that we have the base of the

235
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.440 
neck lowered Let's not use the grab brush
just to adjust these shapes just a bit

236
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.560 
more again Let's use our reference as a
guide when it comes to these shapes So I

237
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.120 
just adjust all of these base shapes just
like we did with the head just to push

238
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.600 
them roughly into position
So now that we have these rough shapes in

239
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.060 
place Let's start dialing them in to
create some of these more defining shapes

240
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.040 
For example, let's get started with the nose
If we look at our reference we can see we

241
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.940 
have this particular shape when it comes
to the nose So let's not get our grab

242
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.980 
brush and I start adjusting the shape of
our nose to fit this shape

243
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.600 
So we're gonna drag these sides inwards
just a bit like so let's continue all the

244
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.640 
way down to the bottom Let's just push up
the nose.

245
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.660 
Just create these nostril shapes now here
from below I want to make sure is to

246
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.360 
separate out the nose from the cheeks If
we look at our reference over here, we

247
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.420 
can see that the nose goes quite a bit
into the face

248
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.840 
So let's just adjust this over here as well.

249
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.100 
Just push the nose further into the head

250
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.700 
Now focus on this side of the head now,
so I just adjust the shape again Let's

251
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.880 
focus on the profile that we can see in
our reference next up.

252
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.840 
We can see this nasal labial area over
here This is basically this group of

253
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.560 
fatty tissue that goes from the bridge of
the nose all the way to the side of the

254
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.560 
mouth We can see how these shapes blend together
If we look at the muscles below we can

255
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.940 
see we have this indentation over here
near the nose And we can see further

256
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.820 
towards the cheek.

257
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.980 
We have those cheekbones pushing this

258
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.840 
shape out again So let's use the grab
brush just to push this back into the

259
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.280 
face But let's maintain this cheekbone
area over here on the top Let's now use

260
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.920 
the crease brush just to push in this
area just a little bit more just to

261
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.200 
create that indentation We spoke of earlier.

262
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.780 
So just like that.

263
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.480 
We're starting to separate out the nose
from the cheek and the eyes Now speaking

264
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.460 
about eyes, let's focus on this area over
here so let's add a bit more of a volume

265
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.900 
where the eyes would be so we just have a
bit of reference of this tissue which

266
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.160 
Goes around the eye.

267
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.260 
So

268
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.700 
let's have a look at our reference Once
again, we can see we have this tissue

269
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.820 
around the eyeball and then we have this
brow going into the side of the face

270
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.160 
So we just use our crease brush just to
create these shapes as well.

271
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.260 
I just pushed this in over here Let's
also bring out the cheekbone a bit more

272
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.420 
now go on to the front view Let's use our
grab brush just to make this head just a

273
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.860 
bit thinner Let's use the grab brush just
to adjust the shape of the brow I just

274
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.960 
grabbed this and it's pushes down and
just ever so slightly Now move our

275
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:02.300 
reference to the front of the face Just
adjust the brow again pushing it down to

276
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:08.660 
create that shape and blend it into the
nose and then down Towards the tip of the

277
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.580 
nose now when it comes to the cheeks and
brow I like to use this reference

278
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:18.260 
material that's at this 45 degree angle
here We can see the profile and the

279
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.940 
volume of these shapes.

280
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.900 
So let's just adjust the cheeks a bit.

281
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:27.380 
Let's push these out Let's also push out
a bit the brow over here So I just drag

282
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:32.280 
that out to create that shape now the
handy piece of reference are these planar

283
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.260 
references These basically simplify all
of these shapes in their most simplest

284
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.760 
form so this really helps us find these
base shapes

285
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.400 
So we look at our reference over here and
we compare it to our sculpt We can see we

286
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.700 
already have these nice cheeks, but we
need to improve upon this chin area over

287
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.400 
here We lack that contrast.

288
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.960 
Let's push this in over here with the

289
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:55.880 
grab brush doing the same for the nose So
this nasal labial area, let's make sure

290
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.760 
we push this in a bit more again
Although we're working at a very lower

291
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.640 
solution We really want to try to dial in
these big shapes just so we have all of

292
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:10.160 
these landmarks in place I just tweak
these ever so slightly and again, this is

293
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.980 
all based on this reference that we have
Right, so now that we have all of these

294
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.060 
bigger shapes in place.

295
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.620 
We can focus on some of these smaller

296
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.380 
details now
We're not gonna go into high resolution

297
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:24.980 
just yet We're still gonna focus on this
low resolution model to get these shapes

298
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.840 
in place
So I'm gonna focus on these muscle shapes

299
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:32.080 
over here we want to you know, introduce
these shapes I want to avoid going too

300
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.980 
much into detail So that's what we're
gonna stay at this lower solution now to

301
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.240 
line up a bit our camera with this
reference I'm gonna increase the focal length.

302
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:47.300 
So I'm gonna set this to I think 95
Millimeters just so it's a bit easier to

303
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.520 
line up with this reference that we have
over here

304
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.020 
So also reduce a bit the distortion we
get from our perspective.

305
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:57.660 
So if I go back to 45 Millimeters you can
see we can love this distortion going on

306
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.620 
which can kind of confuse us.

307
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.780 
So let's set it back to 95 Let's start

308
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.740 
adding in some of these muscle shapes.

309
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.260 
So the focus over here on the cheekbone

310
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.440 
area over here So I got the crease brush.

311
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.980 
I'm gonna reduce the strength a bit more

312
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.340 
I'm gonna bring out this cheek shape that
we can see in our reference over here.

313
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:21.600 
So I just drag Out this shape for a cheek
We also have this deposit of muscles and

314
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.660 
fatty tissue around the corner of the
mouth Let's use the crease brush this

315
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:31.280 
time to push out just around The mouth
then use the smooth brush just to blend

316
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.600 
this back into the face You can start
blending this crease over here as well.

317
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.540 
So let's hold shift just to blend this in
over here I think the smooth brush is a

318
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.820 
bit too strong So I'm gonna reduce the
strength of the smooth brush

319
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.020 
So now when we try to blend these shapes
the smooth brush won't be so intense

320
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:50.140 
So before we continue adding some of
these facial muscles and these facial

321
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.640 
features I want to focus on the overall
shape of the head for a second now that

322
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.440 
we've increased the focal length We can
tell that we still have a lot of this egg shape

323
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:02.200 
So we need to adjust some of these areas
over here and push these nicely in to

324
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.080 
create the correct shape for the head So
let's use our grab brush.

325
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:11.360 
Let's start pushing in these areas Along
the silhouette for example these ears.

326
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.120 
Let's push them a bit further into the
head So from the back over here to grab

327
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.400 
the back of the ears just push those in
so just the Shape the head over here.

328
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:26.040 
We can use The planar reference that we
have over here from different angles to

329
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:32.820 
help us guide the shape of the head So
you can see we can push this area in over

330
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:39.280 
here Those ears in somewhat more Okay,
just the shape of the head itself Okay,

331
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.440 
we're looking mainly at the silhouette of
our reference.

332
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:46.580 
This will help us guide These shapes same
goes over here for the top of the head

333
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.220 
Let's line up the head to our reference.

334
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.420 
Let's just adjust the overall shape of

335
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.860 
the head over here
So I think it's good to overall Review

336
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.440 
your work as you're going over the model
For example, if we go to the forehead

337
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:04.780 
over here We can see although we have
this indentation at the front where we

338
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.320 
have the forehead It doesn't blend in
nicely to the back.

339
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.840 
So if I draw this out over here So
instead of straight and then we go BAM

340
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:17.280 
into the side So instead what we want is
the forehead to gradually transition into

341
00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.140 
the back of the skull So for this we can
just use our grab brush just to push in

342
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.000 
these sides over here
So we get this nice softer transition

343
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.160 
into the back of the head
So if we now go to our front view we can

344
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.560 
see we have this indentation the side of
the head

345
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:36.840 
So if we go back to our reference over here
, we can see we have this soft transition

346
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.940 
into the side I'll just use our grab
brush just to remove any of these harsh

347
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.240 
bumps over here For example over here and
I just push in these areas just so this

348
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.400 
transition is a bit smoother Now in
general when it comes to the head, it's

349
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.740 
good to use a reference of a skull as
especially for the top and back Of the head.

350
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.480 
It's basically just a skull with skin on
it So let's compare our head to the

351
00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:03.060 
silhouette that we can see over here of
our skull We can see that our head is a

352
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.900 
bit too square if that makes sense So
let's just adjust this with our grab

353
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.580 
brush again Focusing on the silhouette of
our head over here.

354
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:16.040 
So now focus on the side of the head
Let's get the reference to the side of

355
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.200 
the skull and again want to focus on the
silhouette over here

356
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:24.620 
So I just the silhouette of our head to
fit a bit the silhouette of this

357
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.980 
reference that we have over here
So by continuing to focus on this

358
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.400 
silhouette, we're starting to get a good
base shape for the head

359
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.640 
So getting these shapes in as early as
possible really helps against having to

360
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:41.340 
go back later to adjust these proportions
So I like to spend quite a bit of time

361
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.040 
over here at this low resolution just to
bring in these base shapes

362
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.720 
So now we've gone over the head.

363
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.740 
Let's focus on this brow area over here.

364
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.000 
So to start off Let's bring out this brow
shape again

365
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:56.560 
So let's go over here with our crease
brush and that's pushing this side area

366
00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.020 
over here Just to create this temple
shape over here.

367
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:05.560 
Just push in this side over here Let's
also focus on this frontal area of the skull.

368
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.880 
So let's push in this circular shape Now
for this, I want to have a sharper crease.

369
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.580 
So let's set the falloff to the sharper curve
So get a sharper crease.

370
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.940 
I'm just going to create this circular
shape over here

371
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.080 
For the forehead
So let's keep pushing this in And holding

372
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:28.620 
shift just to blend this back into the
forehead Now focus on the eye area over here.

373
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:33.360 
We got this tissue right above the eye So
I'm going to use the crease brush just to

374
00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:39.320 
bring this out over here And just holding
ctrl just to bring this forward over here

375
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:44.620 
And then separate out where the eyes are
going to be as well Now once we have the

376
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:48.220 
eyes separated out we can focus on this
eye socket shape over here

377
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:53.860 
So let's again just create that eye
socket shape over here with our crease

378
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.000 
brush Let's now slowly work our way down.

379
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.600 
So we also got our cheekbones.

380
00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.460 
We already got them quite defined But I
just want to bring out a landmark over here

381
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.660 
So let's just drag out a crease along the
high point over here I also want to

382
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.380 
connect this shape up to the nose.

383
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.500 
I also want to define this nasal labial

384
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.020 
area over here
So let's use the crease brush once again

385
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.940 
over here Let's also separate out a bit
the nose from the face

386
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.800 
And again, I'm just using the crease
brush just to create the separation

387
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.160 
between these areas over here for the
mouth as well Let's just push in this

388
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:30.860 
area over here Where the lips would meet
This already gives us a good

389
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.980 
representation of where the mouth would
be Then we can move on further down just

390
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:40.400 
to separate out the lips from where the
chin starts Let's just create this crease

391
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.460 
over here at the tip of the chin.

392
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.280 
Let's just smooth this back out And

393
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.700 
create this definite crease over here So
just like that we're starting to get a

394
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.880 
lot of landmarks for the face even at
this low resolution We can start dialing

395
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:58.000 
it in even more if we want to for example
over here adding To the nostrils, but we

396
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.020 
can already see the face shining through
the lack of details

397
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:07.580 
We're getting the overview of the overall
face shape so this is a good stage to

398
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:12.080 
start manipulating all of the The
different facets of the face to get the

399
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.840 
face that you're looking for
So from here, we can just make tweaks

400
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.520 
with the grab brush just to adjust
proportions just to get the face shape

401
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.240 
that we're looking for So we can make all
of these tweaks and then as soon as we're

402
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.940 
happy with the result that we have over
here We can then move on to adding more

403
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.800 
resolution and then adding the next level
of details Now have you been watching

404
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.280 
this video up to this point?

405
00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.560 
I think you have a liking towards

406
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.620 
sculpting in blender
So if you want to improve your skills

407
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:41.520 
have a look at zach's course on mastering
sculpting in blender over here You won't

408
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:42.860 
just learn the fundamentals.

409
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.340 
You'll learn a whole variety of advanced

410
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.680 
techniques and how to get better in sculpting
So if you're interested in this have a

411
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.340 
look at the link in the description below
This is also a great way to support us so

412
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.580 
we can make more videos like this one
So over here back to our head i've gone

413
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.740 
ahead and added a bit more resolution.

414
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.800 
I've set the voxel remesher to 0 .0085

415
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.620 
and then by simply pressing ctrl r i've
remeshed our model once again

416
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.860 
Now at this point it might be hard to
know where to start what to do

417
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.240 
But it's basically the same that we've
done before we're just gonna build very

418
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.100 
softly from a distance these details
Starting with the big shapes and then

419
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.340 
working our way down
So let's start for example with this eye

420
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.020 
area over here.

421
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.520 
Let's use the clay strips brush Reduce

422
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:29.320 
the strength, but I think i'm gonna push
it up just ever so slightly I also want

423
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:34.020 
to disable the radius being controlled by
my pen pressure I only want the strength

424
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.220 
to be affected by my pen pressure just so
I feel like I have a bit more control

425
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.640 
I'm, just gonna sketch out this area
around the eye again.

426
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:47.100 
I'm just trying to follow the shape that
we can see in our reference so i'm using

427
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.020 
the Crease brush just to push this area
in I'm gonna do the Bottom part of the eye.

428
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:58.400 
So i'm gonna push this out Like so and I
use the crease brush once again Just to

429
00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:59.860 
push in This area.

430
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.940 
So again, we're staying out at a distance.

431
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:07.200 
We're not going into a lot of detail just
yet We're just sketching out these base

432
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.600 
shapes next up.

433
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.480 
I'm gonna bring out this crease above the

434
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.500 
upper eyelid Just going over here with a
small brush Just sketching out that shape

435
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.400 
again, we're being quite rough since we
can so we're just creating these base

436
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.680 
shapes just going over These areas to
bring out these landmarks

437
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.340 
So now we've brought out the base shape
for these eyelids.

438
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.440 
Let's make sure that they're round keep
in mind.

439
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:34.960 
We have an eyeball Supposedly below these
so let's just use our grab brush just to

440
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.040 
push these out I think i'm gonna need a
smoother grab brush.

441
00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:46.640 
Let's set the fall off to smoother Let's
just adjust the shape Of these eyelids

442
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.620 
imagining a eyeball right below it
Again, we're still in the early stages so

443
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.580 
we can tweak these eyelids However, we
like now they feel quite flat to me.

444
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.560 
So i'm going to get the crease brush I'm
not going to push in the corners of our

445
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.620 
eyes over here So i'm going to push in
this corner over here and i'm going to

446
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.140 
push in this corner here as well Now you
might be asking why I haven't added a

447
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.080 
sphere for the eyeball as a as a
reference Now I don't add these this

448
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.280 
early on as I feel that they kind of
Subconsciously anchor you to these

449
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.400 
eyeballs you try to make these eyelids
fit these eyeballs

450
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:21.820 
While maybe your eyes are not the shape
or size that you want So I like to add

451
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:26.520 
them on later and first focus on the
overall shape and size of the eyes

452
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.620 
So to illustrate let's adjust the shape
and size of our eyes right now So for

453
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.100 
this let's use our mask tool.

454
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.120 
Let's mask out the eyes.

455
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.880 
Let's now invert our mask with ctrl i
Let's now set the pivot where our mask is

456
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:44.900 
so let's go to sculpt let's now go to set
pivot set pivot to unmasked

457
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.500 
Let's now go to our scale tool and
as you can see our pivot is now where we

458
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.560 
have our eye We can now start scaling
this area.

459
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.280 
So we're going to make our eyes a bit
smaller We can also go to our move tool

460
00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.260 
and we can move our eye wherever we want
them to be

461
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:04.340 
So let's move it a bit closer Let's move
it also a bit further into the head Like

462
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.480 
so it's a whole lot easier to adjust and
modify the eyes without having this

463
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.560 
eyeball in the way So now with the base
shape for our eyes done.

464
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:18.080 
Let's focus on the nose i'm just going to
use the crease brush just to bring out

465
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.260 
the Nostril over here and there's a very
simple nostril shape.

466
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:26.440 
I'm also going to push in the nose holes
again We're just trying to focus on these

467
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.520 
base shapes and as you can see most of
the heavy lifting has been done by the

468
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.660 
work that we did before since the Overall
shape of the nose is already there i'm

469
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.200 
not going to use the clay strips brush
just to bring out this shape in the nose

470
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.720 
over here.

471
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.260 
We got this part just above the nostril

472
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:46.420 
that's Joining back into this And this
nasal labial area and then from here We

473
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:51.020 
want to push in the part of the nose
where we have the bridge Joining up to

474
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:54.500 
the tip of the nose right over here
So let's just continue pushing this in

475
00:24:54.510 --> 00:25:00.700 
with the clay strips brush also over here
alongside Where it joins towards the eye

476
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.220 
Just like that.

477
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.900 
We're starting to get a very simple nose

478
00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.720 
shape What does these very few adjustments?

479
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.920 
Let's have a look at the side of our nose

480
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.980 
I'm going to look at the profile over here.

481
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.340 
You can use the grab brush just to adjust

482
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.860 
The profile i'm going to get this nice
straight nose Let's adjust a bit the tip

483
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.300 
over here.

484
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.340 
Just pushing it down ever so slightly Now

485
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.100 
at the risk of sounding like a broken
record again We want to focus on these

486
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.240 
big shapes.

487
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.960 
We're going to focus on the details just yet.

488
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:32.660 
Just adjusting these base shapes
So let's now move on from our nose to our mouth.

489
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:37.260 
Let's use the crease brush just to push
in over here where the lips would meet

490
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:42.920 
I'm going to use control just to push out
the edges Of both the upper lip and over

491
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.760 
here now the bottom lip
And as you can see most of the heavy

492
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.660 
lifting has been done by what we did
before where we had the base shape over

493
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.200 
here We're now just refining these shapes.

494
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:53.000 
So let's continue.

495
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.260 
Let's focus on this area over here I'm
going to add some more volume around the

496
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.500 
corner of the mouth This is the area
where a lot of muscles come together.

497
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:06.620 
There's also a lot of tissue over here So
this is this node on the corner of the

498
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:11.120 
mouth Let's just add some volume over
here the clay strips brush Just doing

499
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.820 
this gradual build up and then holding
shift just to blend these shapes nicely

500
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.620 
back together Now over here, we can also
add a bit more volume below the lips over

501
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:24.920 
here and hold shift to blend these together
So let's now move back to our nose and

502
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.280 
brow for a second
And let's just look at this reference

503
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.980 
that we have over here of this scan now,
although the nose is completely different

504
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.280 
There's still parts that we can glean
from this.

505
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.540 
For example, the bottom of our nose can
probably go forward just a bit over here

506
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:43.020 
You can also see that the chin of our
character might go down a bit further

507
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:47.700 
over here I think we can also bring the
brow down ever so slightly We can also

508
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:51.980 
add a bit more volume to this brow just
like we can see in our reference It's

509
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:57.540 
filling in this space over here just
above this crease From the upper eyelid.

510
00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.800 
We don't want to copy directly what we
see in our reference instead What we want

511
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:06.240 
to do is find these shapes within our
reference that we can then apply to our face

512
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:11.200 
So let's now smooth this area of our brow
this volume that we just added And now

513
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.500 
with this let's focus on this center area
of the brow

514
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:19.200 
So if we go to our reference if we focus
this area over here, we have this

515
00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.520 
triangular shape Let's see this better
let's go to the front of the face in our

516
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:24.340 
reference You can see here.

517
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.560 
We have this triangular shape.

518
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:32.080 
So let's use the crease brush Just to
bring out this triangular shape like so

519
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:38.360 
As you can see we're starting to bring in
these shapes bit by bit Over time getting

520
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.020 
into more detail.

521
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.860 
So we're not focused yet on creating the

522
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:45.660 
eye just perfect or anything like that
We're just bringing these shapes ever so

523
00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.580 
slightly bit by bit.

524
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.060 
So i'm now going to focus again on this

525
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.380 
cheekbone area over here
It goes all the way towards the ear.

526
00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.740 
So i'm going to drag this out with the
crease brush Now, I think this is a bit

527
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.900 
too strong.

528
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.780 
So i'm going to undo that drag Out this

529
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:04.580 
the shape over here and hold shift just
to blend these back in again This is just

530
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:09.120 
a landmark for us to to work off from
next up i'm going to work on this area

531
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.360 
over here This nasal labial area i'm just
going to drag this crease down again.

532
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.660 
This is just going to be a landmark
So to see this let's have a look at our

533
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.040 
reference once again Let's look at this
scan over here over here.

534
00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:25.080 
You can see this nasal labial area
So now that we have created these

535
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:30.700 
landmarks, let's get our cleanser brush
and start filling in some of these these

536
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:35.220 
these crevices With some fatty tissue at
least i'm trying to imagine it being this

537
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.420 
fatty tissue.

538
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.840 
So i'm just going to connect up some of

539
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.720 
these shapes Just doing some soft build
-up with the clay strips brush.

540
00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:47.540 
So over here i'm filling in a bit the eye
socket I'm, also going to add a bit of

541
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:53.020 
build -up around the nose Just doing this
soft build -up with the clay strips brush

542
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.880 
Here we're just going to try and fill in
some of these areas trying to blend the

543
00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:00.800 
nose and the eyes nicely together Again,
we're using reference.

544
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:06.080 
I have reference on my second screen Just
to guide these these decisions

545
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.940 
So i'm going to focus on this area above
the upper eyelid I really want to bring

546
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:15.500 
out this shape over here this this tissue
that slightly overlaps on top of the

547
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.920 
upper eyelid
So i'm going to get the clay strips brush

548
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.440 
over here I'm, just going to add a bit
more volume to this area over here this

549
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:26.240 
crease that i've just drawn Just to fill
out this shape over here now for the

550
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:26.460 
lower eyelid.

551
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.460 
Let's do the exact same thing over here

552
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.400 
Let's define this shape.

553
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.480 
So I think we can use a crease brush for this

554
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:37.860 
So let's just define this shape to create
these creases below over here Just to

555
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.920 
define the shape of the eyelid.

556
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.880 
So just create this crease over here

557
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:46.440 
Let's now get the clay strips brush and
let's add some volume to this lower

558
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.940 
eyelid to again define the shape
So let's just use a small brush and just

559
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:56.440 
add a bit of volume over here Now swap to
the grab brush and just simply adjust a

560
00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:01.920 
bit the edge of these eyelids Now once
we're happy we can swap to the flatten

561
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.120 
brush I'm going to set the normal radius
of the flatten brush

562
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:10.560 
To one so basically increase the radius
from which the normal is sampled

563
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:15.320 
So the bigger the number the more average
the normal of our brush will be so we're

564
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:19.760 
not using this normal to flatten our surface
So what we're doing basically is getting

565
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:24.640 
all of this noise along the surface
Finding the average normal and then

566
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.660 
flattening it to that normal
So I like to think of this as a polishing

567
00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:34.080 
brush i'm removing all of this high noise
all of these Noisy bits of the surface

568
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:39.220 
and generating this averaged polished
surface It also makes it easier to blend

569
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.940 
certain shapes together basically finding
the average between these two shapes So

570
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.120 
now we have this polished up.

571
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.520 
Let's get the crease brush.

572
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:50.640 
Let's create this overlap with the upper
eyelid over here Just pushing this out

573
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.840 
holding control Now over here below.

574
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.080 
I want to focus on bringing out this eye

575
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.280 
socket shape It's one of those shapes we
often forget But it's a fundamental part

576
00:30:59.410 --> 00:30:59.920 
of the face.

577
00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.580 
Let's just bring out this eye socket

578
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:08.620 
shape i'm going to use a small size brush
just to bring out a sketch of this shape

579
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.960 
of the The eye socket just so we have it
as a reference

580
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.680 
So now that we've pushed in this area, we
have this part sticking out over here.

581
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.700 
That's bothering me
So i'm going to get the scrape brush.

582
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:22.680 
I'm just going to scrape away this harsh
edge over here Just so it blends nicely

583
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:27.980 
back into the face You can just continue
using the scrape brush just to remove any

584
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:32.500 
of these harsher edges You can continue
along this side of the mouth over here.

585
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:36.960 
Although it's a Rounder shape we can
remove any of these parts that are

586
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.500 
sticking out too far.

587
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.360 
Let's now continue our work downwards

588
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.520 
Let's focus on this mouth area over here.

589
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.320 
Let's clean up a bit the philtrum over here.

590
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:50.200 
Let's also adjust This area over here
with the grab brush

591
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:56.860 
Look at the nose as well while we're here
Just move this back a bit Let's have a

592
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.940 
look at those lips as well.

593
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.780 
Just move this lower lip up just ever so

594
00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.460 
slightly it's also just the upper lip
over here, let's just Push this up.

595
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:09.540 
This really creates this sort of winged
shape for the upper lip I'm, also going

596
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:13.880 
to use the grab brush on the side of the
mouth over here Just to blend the shape a

597
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.280 
bit back into the face
Now for this side of the jaw over here,

598
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.740 
let's have a look at this escrochet that
I have over here Over here.

599
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.920 
We can see this masseter muscle.

600
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.460 
This is muscle that opens and closes the jaw.

601
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:30.800 
This is our biting muscle So let's use
our claytrips brush just to define the

602
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.600 
shape Of the masseter muscle.

603
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.780 
This is a muscle that we can often see in

604
00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.580 
the face So it's important that we get
this clearly defined.

605
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:42.580 
I'm just going to add Some volume over
here once i'm happy i'm going to hold

606
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:47.760 
shift And just blend this all nicely
together once again Right, so now that

607
00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:51.720 
we've gone over all of these facial
features and we now have this next level

608
00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.980 
of detail Let's take a step back and
let's have a look at our face once again

609
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:59.740 
And see if we need to adjust any of the
proportions before we continue on to the

610
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.300 
next level
So let's have a look at the proportions

611
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:05.860 
of our face and let's compare them to
some of this reference that we have over here

612
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.980 
So here i'm looking At this scan over
here By the way, I can tell some things

613
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.440 
are off.

614
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.900 
For example, if we look at the ears You

615
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:19.300 
can see our ears are way too high up and
if we look at the side over here I think

616
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:25.560 
we're also way too far Forward so let's
get our mask tool and let's mask out

617
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.780 
these ears So let's mask this all out
Let's smooth our mask and let's also

618
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:34.400 
remove some of the mask closer to the
cheek as we do not want to change the cheek

619
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.680 
Let's now press ctrl i to invert our mask.

620
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.180 
Let's get the move tool and let's move

621
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:45.480 
these ears back a bit When I line up the
top of the ear roughly to where the eyes

622
00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:50.520 
are and the lower part of the ear roughly
to about here So let's just also adjust

623
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:54.280 
the rotation a bit as we can see our ears
are tilted back a bit

624
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.280 
So let's rotate that let's then go back
to our move tool.

625
00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:02.740 
Let's move our ears back just a bit more
So look again at our reference I think we

626
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.480 
can move it back just a bit more like so
now since we're happy with the location

627
00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:09.780 
of our ears We can press alt m to clear
our mask.

628
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.460 
So let's have a look over here You know,
I think this is looking pretty good for

629
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:17.440 
our ears I like to catch these things as
early as possible Just so we don't have

630
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:22.620 
to go over all of these areas once again
later to fix these These minor mistakes.

631
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:27.300 
So if we look over here to the jaw, I can
see me to adjust the angle a bit

632
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:34.100 
So let's move this Up like so now
catching these these minor irregularities

633
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:38.620 
these minor mistakes early on really
saves us From a lot of headaches in the future.

634
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:43.720 
So I like to spend a bit of time over
here Just making these adjustments these corrections

635
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.260 
based on the reference that I have for
example over here I noticed that our nose

636
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.760 
is a bit too far down.

637
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.580 
So i'm going to get the mask tool once

638
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:58.400 
again Mask out our nose Let's remove some
of the mask from the nose as well as the

639
00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.460 
forehead Then invert our mask.

640
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.140 
Let's use the move tool once again just

641
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:06.420 
to move our nose up just a bit Like so
Let's now clear our mask.

642
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:07.880 
Let's have a look at our face.

643
00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:09.700 
I think it's looking a lot better already

644
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.840 
I think I can move the mouth up by a
small amount.

645
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.160 
So let's get our mask tool.

646
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.440 
Let's mask our mouth out Invert our mask.

647
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.020 
Let's get the move tool.

648
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.640 
Let's just move the mouth up just by a

649
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.880 
small amount Let's now clear our mask.

650
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.220 
Let's have a look at our mouth I think

651
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:29.040 
it's looking pretty good, but I think we
can move our mouth a bit further forward

652
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:33.460 
So let's press ctrl z let's get our mask
again Let's move the mouth forward by

653
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.240 
just a small amount the face from the
side should have a very slight triangular

654
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.080 
shape to it And the corner of the mouth
should more or less line up to where the

655
00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:44.900 
eyes are
So now these adjustments made I want to

656
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:50.260 
focus a bit on the forehead over here I
think we push this a bit too far forward

657
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:56.680 
and move the brow back a bit move this
part out a bit Using the grab brush just

658
00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:02.660 
to make these small tweaks for example
over here at the forehead Again, looking

659
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:10.960 
at the reference that you can see on the
screen trying to make The same shape for

660
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:11.780 
the head now keep in mind.

661
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.080 
I'm not trying to copy this.

662
00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:19.680 
I'm just trying to find these shapes over
here, for example how the brow softly

663
00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:24.520 
blends into the side of the head And
looking at the silhouette of the head

664
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.120 
again, we're just trying to find these
elements within the face

665
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.760 
We're not trying to copy the exact same
face from the reference Instead we want

666
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:36.140 
to get these elements and incorporate
them into our face now the flatten brush.

667
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:42.180 
I'm just gonna Slowly blend the brow into
the side of the face I'm going to clean

668
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:47.760 
up this area over here on the side I
don't have to worry about the ears just yet.

669
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.500 
We'll take care of that later Just focus
on the face for now.

670
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.900 
I get the crease brush.

671
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.800 
I'm trying to create this divide between

672
00:36:55.810 --> 00:37:00.100 
the brows Just going to create this small
crease between the brows the same over

673
00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:03.660 
here between the nose and the brow I've
gone a bit too far.

674
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:10.940 
I get the grab brush and move the nose
back a bit And move the brow forwards Now

675
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.060 
the nose itself we need to do a few
tweaks later

676
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:18.900 
But for now, we're just focusing on the
big shapes so we can ignore all of the

677
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.700 
incorrect Shapes on the small scale.

678
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.420 
We're just focusing on the big shapes for

679
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:30.350 
now Move this Forward as well over here
Again, we're just trying to get the

680
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.830 
overall big shapes in place Before we
start cleaning up and tidying up all of

681
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.390 
these facial features Let's now focus a
bit on this cheek area over here again

682
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.790 
I'm going to use the silhouette of our
reference use the grab brush just to push

683
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.690 
out some of this tissue over here around
the cheeks I like to zoom out to make

684
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:53.550 
sure I can see the full big picture and
battle against my tunnel vision

685
00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.870 
So let's just push these areas in over
here Just to adjust again the muscles in

686
00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.030 
the face now talking about muscles.

687
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.370 
I want to define again the masseter

688
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.670 
muscle over here I'm going to use the
cloister brush just to fill this area in

689
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.770 
over here again just to bring out this
masseter muscle i'm going to swap back to

690
00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:16.410 
the grab brush and just blend these
shapes together by Raising and lowering

691
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:21.350 
the surface just trying to Think of where
all this fatty tissue is as the face is

692
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:26.210 
full of this Fatty tissue that basically
blends all of these muscle shapes

693
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:30.030 
together For example over here in the eye
corner We can add some of this fatty

694
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:36.090 
tissue as it were to blend the eye socket
out towards the side of the head I don't

695
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.330 
think the fill tool is doing it here.

696
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.430 
So i'm going to use the Claystrips brush

697
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.750 
just to dig into the Side of the face
over here around this eye corner.

698
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:50.450 
I'm going to use the flatten brush Just
to polish these shapes back into one

699
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:56.110 
another just going over these areas over
here these very short strokes Let's blend

700
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.970 
these shapes together Now as we're
blending it makes it look like we have

701
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:05.350 
this layer of skin this fatty tissue that
blends Between these somewhat harsher shapes.

702
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.290 
So I think with this we've made some good
adjustments to the structure of the face

703
00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.750 
Let's now move on to having some more
details for example to the ear

704
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.190 
So, all right, let's now have a look at
the ears for our character So at the

705
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.850 
moment our ears are quite basic.

706
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.150 
We still have the base shape over here So

707
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.370 
let's start building upon these shapes.

708
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.570 
So i'm going to look over to this

709
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.810 
reference over here I'm going to create
these basic shapes now before we start off.

710
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.050 
I want to make sure we fix these Areas
that we have broken up.

711
00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:36.510 
So i'm going to get the flatten brush
I'm, just going to go and clear up this

712
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.230 
area over here
So now with that kind of smoothed out and

713
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.930 
flattened let's focus on these base
shapes over here

714
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:46.190 
So i'm going to get the clay strips brush
and i'm going to bring out these base shapes

715
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.190 
So i'm going to start over here with the
bottom area over here.

716
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.670 
I'm just going to bring out this green
shape Then we've got this purple shape

717
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.470 
going all the way around Create these landmarks.

718
00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:58.910 
Okay.

719
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.370 
I'm just drawing on top of the shape that
we have this yellow shape as well, this

720
00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:11.150 
is sort of a Y shape And we've got this
light blue shape that's inside the Ear,

721
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.470 
so i'm going to push this down again.

722
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.390 
This is just to create these landmarks

723
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.610 
We're not trying to get the right shape
just yet.

724
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.170 
We're just creating these Landmarks now
the final shape is this little red shape

725
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.010 
over here So let's just bring it out
again with the clay strip brush Now as

726
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:29.130 
for the back of the ear, let's have a
look at our reference we have this

727
00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.830 
Reference over here of the back of the
ear Quite a simple shape.

728
00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.730 
We got the helix over here Now we got
this cylinder connecting the ear to the

729
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:43.210 
rest of the head So let's now use the
clay surf brush to separate out the helix

730
00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.750 
from this cylinder shape connecting to
the head Now appear to be causing some

731
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.370 
artifacts over here
with the clay surf brush

732
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.750 
So i'm going to swap to the crease brush
and again i'm just going to create the

733
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.190 
separation between the helix and this
cylinder shape so it's going to be Quite

734
00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:58.470 
rough over here.

735
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.530 
I'm just going to push this in again

736
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:07.090 
trying to get this tube shape for the
Back of the ear i'm being quite rough

737
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.630 
over here But this is fine since we're
just focusing on trying to get these base

738
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.830 
shapes in place So i don't have to worry
yet about making a mess.

739
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.730 
I'm going to use the grab brush just to
push this Tube shape a bit further into

740
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.770 
the ear I think i'm going to use the
flatten brush now just to polish away

741
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.390 
some of this mess that we created Around
the ear.

742
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.910 
So now with that, let's go back to the
side of the head.

743
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.770 
Let's get our grab brush Let's start
adjusting these shapes to fit more the

744
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.450 
ear shape that we're going for We don't
want our ears to be too big.

745
00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.730 
So let's adjust this look at the front view
So let's move our reference over here,

746
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.930 
let's use the grab brush just to bring
out this area over here I want to create

747
00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.430 
the Ear shape the rough ear shape over here.

748
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.210 
I don't want to focus yet on the small

749
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:57.310 
details We just want to bring out the
rough base shape for the ear

750
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.710 
So now that we have our ear roughly in
the shape that we want to let's start

751
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.130 
bringing out some of these shapes I'm
going to start over here to bring out

752
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.730 
this purple shape This is called the
helix the helix goes all the way around

753
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.030 
to the end over here Then we have the
yellow shape.

754
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.870 
This is called the anti helix
You can see by the shadow that this is

755
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.110 
quite deep into the ears I'm going to use
the grab brush over here just to push

756
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.350 
this in We can be quite rough because if
we distort any part too far we can just

757
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.050 
fix it quite easily with the grab brush
Let's now get the crease brush.

758
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:35.750 
Let's create this clear separation
between the helix over here and the anti helix

759
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:41.150 
Let's also dedicate a bit of time over
here to bring back the y shape for the

760
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.850 
anti helix
Let's follow this all the way down to the

761
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:49.390 
bottom over here and we can see that this
shape continues on Inwards towards the face.

762
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.950 
So I just bring this out with the crease
brush like so

763
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.750 
So now that we have these base shapes in
place Let's have a look at our scan over

764
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.590 
here Now we can see over here that this
inner shape this yellow shape sticks out

765
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.290 
by quite a bit
So let's do the same for our ear I like

766
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.350 
this design because I see that the top
goes inwards a bit more So let's push

767
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.750 
that in and what we basically have is
this outer shape which creates this very

768
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:18.270 
familiar ear shape And we have this anti
helix this inner shape that creates this

769
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.690 
s shape
So now that i'm happy with this base

770
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:25.070 
shape i'm going to go over these areas
with the clay strips brush Just to fill

771
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.970 
in some of these cavities just to add a
bit more volume to some of these parts of

772
00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.810 
the ear
Now once i'm happy with these shapes i'm

773
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:37.330 
going to hold shift and smooth these
areas to blur them back into one another

774
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:41.350 
Now this might seem counterproductive
But in fact this helps to create this

775
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.770 
nice flow between these shapes And I can
then simply use the crease brush just to

776
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.450 
bring these details and these forms back
into these now flowing shapes

777
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.410 
So just going over these areas over here.

778
00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.730 
Just pushing it in this crease brush

779
00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:01.410 
looking at the reference comparing The
shape that we have over here with the

780
00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:08.070 
reference i'm going to push in a bit the
shape of the helix here pushing in the

781
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:12.310 
This indentation that we have on the
inside of the helix We separate it out

782
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.890 
from the anti helix area is quite
separated in our reference.

783
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.530 
So let's create this Larger separation
let's continue this separation down

784
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.610 
between the two helices bring it all the
way down towards the earlobe

785
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.650 
And I get the grab brush just to adjust
the shape of the earlobe i'm going to

786
00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:33.070 
bring it out a bit So it's starting to
look pretty good for our ear already Now

787
00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.970 
before calling it a day Let's make sure
we look at different angles when it comes

788
00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.070 
to our reference Over here.

789
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.690 
We can already see me to bring out a bit

790
00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:44.530 
more of this shape within the anti helix
So let's push out this area over here.

791
00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:49.550 
Let's now hold shift to blend that back
in I'm going to push in this upper area

792
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.470 
over here Let's just create this Y shape
you can also notice we can create more of

793
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.150 
a separation between the anti helix and
this inner part of the ear We also want

794
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.990 
to bring out this interesting edge that
we can see along the helix.

795
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.950 
I'm just bringing out This shape over
here along the helix This really

796
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:13.270 
separates the helix out from the anti
helix and over here at the back I'm going

797
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.970 
to focus on this area over here just to
separate out the The back of the helix

798
00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:23.090 
from this tubular shape, so let's just
smooth this out over here

799
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.030 
Use the crease brush again to redefine
these shapes Now back to the side of the

800
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:28.570 
ear over here.

801
00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.550 
We can see this interesting shape in our

802
00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:36.830 
reference We can see this indentation as
the helix enters the ear as well as this

803
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.090 
crease going down the side of the ear
So let's create this first crease over here.

804
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.610 
Let's also create this crease on the side
It's just the angle.

805
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.850 
Let's push it in
Let's now get the flatten brush.

806
00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.950 
Let's just blend this crease into the
face Same for this top crease over here

807
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.930 
Just blend that back into the face Let's
now go over this whole area with the

808
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.850 
flatten brush just to reduce the
intensity of this crease

809
00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.630 
So now that we added the ears to our
head, let's focus on this last bit over here.

810
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.230 
Let's focus on the neck
So the first thing that stands out is

811
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.910 
that our neck is too far to the back over
here It looks like our character is

812
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.750 
pushing his head forward.

813
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.330 
So let's make this neck a bit more straight

814
00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.010 
Now for this we can use the same
technique that we used for the ears mouth

815
00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:25.430 
and nose Let's get the mask tool and
start masking out the neck over here

816
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:31.790 
Let's now remove from the mask the jaw
and head Let's now smooth the mask again

817
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.230 
Let's now invert the mask.

818
00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:37.330 
Let's use the move tools to move our neck

819
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.970 
Forwards, so let's move our neck far enough.

820
00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.510 
So it doesn't look like our character is

821
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.350 
leaning forwards with its head
So now with that sorted let's focus on

822
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:50.310 
smoothing the surface over here We still
have a lot of rough surface from when we

823
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.670 
remeshed the model.

824
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.810 
So let's clean up The area over here.

825
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.550 
So now that we have smoothed the surface,
let's bring out this adam's apple This is

826
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.650 
a real masculine feature of the neck.

827
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.150 
So let's bring this out.

828
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.890 
It's about Here a bit over the middle of
the neck.

829
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:10.230 
So let's bring this out with the grab
brush again I'm not worried about the

830
00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:10.930 
correct shape just yet.

831
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.070 
We're just bringing out these landmarks

832
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.390 
Now for the rest of the neck, let's bring
out these muscles

833
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.690 
So let's use the crease brush just to
bring out these muscles.

834
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.790 
Now we're getting this nasty dot effect
So to fix this let's go to our stroke

835
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.230 
settings and let's reduce the spacing.

836
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.890 
Let's set it to five percent

837
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.730 
So we're going to disable the adjust
strength feature.

838
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.030 
I'm going to set the strength a bit lower
So if we now create a stroke, you can see

839
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.790 
we're getting a smoother effect since we
now have More steps in our stroke.

840
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.490 
So let's now use the crease brush just to
bring out these shapes of these muscles

841
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.850 
So i'm going to bring out these muscles
over here.

842
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.610 
This is the sternocleidomastoid.

843
00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.990 
I'm going to bring this out over here You

844
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.590 
see again the crease brush Just to define
these landmarks again.

845
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.530 
We're not concerned yet.

846
00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.410 
We're putting them in the correct space

847
00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:00.190 
We're just bringing out these forms at
the bottom over here the muscles separate

848
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.130 
So let's create this separation over here
with the crease brush Let's push this out.

849
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.370 
And now these landmarks we can switch to
our grab brush.

850
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:11.930 
We can just adjust the shape of this
muscle Now one more thing that helps me

851
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.610 
with these muscle shapes is using the
clay strip brush and going along the

852
00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.310 
grain of the muscle Now to illustrate
this a bit better.

853
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.130 
Let's increase the strength of our brush
over here Let's go along the grain of

854
00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.630 
this muscle
And as you can see we create these

855
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.530 
streaks along which really help us read
the shape and flow of this muscle Let's

856
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.090 
now also bring out the clavicle
So i'm going to use the grab brush just

857
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.690 
to push this back a bit towards the neck
I'm going to use the clay strip brush

858
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.230 
once again And before we continue with
these muscles, I quickly want to bring

859
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.870 
out the clavicle
So this is a good landmark to have so i'm

860
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.210 
going to quickly sketch out a rough shape
for this clavicle

861
00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:51.750 
So we have this big piece over here and
we have this smaller longer shape towards

862
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.430 
the shoulder It forms a sort of s shape.

863
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.210 
So let's use our grab brush just to Push

864
00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:01.690 
this into this s shape Just like that we
have our landmark Let's now go back to

865
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.190 
our clay strip brush and start bringing
out these these forms these shapes along

866
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.890 
the muscle
So i'm going to follow the grain and that

867
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.250 
can be quite rough while i'm at it.

868
00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.250 
We're going to create these Sort of

869
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:16.670 
muscle fibers making these long strokes
And from here I can use the grab brush

870
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.610 
just to adjust the shape of the muscle
And due to the fact that we have these

871
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:26.690 
these streaks you can easily see the flow
of these shapes Let's now separate a bit

872
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.250 
the clavicle heads over here I think I'm
going to use the clay strips brush for this.

873
00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:35.950 
I'm going to push this in over here I'm
going to use the claystrips brush just to

874
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:40.890 
connect the muscles to the clavicle over
here And as for the adam's apple, we want

875
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.530 
to create this sort of v -shape
In fact, if we look at our reference, we

876
00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:48.690 
can see this v -shape over here
So I use the crease brush just to bring

877
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.650 
out this v -shape.

878
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.490 
I'm going to use the grab brush Just to

879
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:57.930 
bring the tip out a bit And then the base
back into the neck I'm going to use the

880
00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:58.510 
claystrips brush once again.

881
00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.710 
I'm just going to bring out some more

882
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:06.710 
shapes around this inner section of the
neck I'm going to bring out this area

883
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:13.190 
over here Just alongside the adam's apple
Push in just above Along the side of the

884
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.110 
adam's apple just to really emphasize
this v -shape.

885
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:21.650 
Now I want to connect this up to the chin
So let's bring out some details along the

886
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:25.750 
chin over here And connect this to the
neck over here.

887
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.510 
So this creates this natural line along
the neck over here And then from here we

888
00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:36.390 
can start blending these shapes together
again using the claystrips brush Just to

889
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.350 
blend these forms Now over here at the back.

890
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.190 
Let's continue with these muscle streaks

891
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.530 
So I'm going to go over these areas with
the claystrips brush again thinking of

892
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:49.390 
the shape of the muscles
So for example here we have the trapezius

893
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:54.150 
muscle So let's just bring that out again
following the grain of this muscle with

894
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.270 
our claystrips brush And also like to
create this bump at the base of the neck

895
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.570 
where the bones of the neck sit over here
Now for the trapezius, let's continue

896
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.110 
dragging out these fibers over here.

897
00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.290 
This is a very big muscle.

898
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:11.750 
So let's bring out all of these Fibers
again, this will help us later to push

899
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:17.230 
this all into shape now the grab brush
I'm just going to adjust the the shape of

900
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:23.410 
these muscles Again, now that we have the
flow Drawn out it's easier to find the

901
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.750 
shape for these muscles Now this stage is
important to use a reference just so you

902
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.510 
can see where these muscles go And what
shape they have and since we have this

903
00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.630 
streak pattern it's easier to follow the
flow of these muscles

904
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.790 
Now once i'm happy with these shapes i'm
going to use the flatten brush just to

905
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:44.890 
blend again these shapes all nicely
together Now with that i'm going to use

906
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:49.550 
the smooth brush just to finalize the
blending and create a nice smooth surface

907
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.390 
Now we lost a lot of detail by blending
these surfaces together So i'm going to

908
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.890 
use the crease brush just to bring some
details back into these shapes For

909
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.410 
example over here.

910
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.490 
Let's bring out the sternocleidomastoid

911
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:07.030 
Just bring that all the way down over
here Let's just push this in with the

912
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.450 
crease brush Let's also separate out a
bit more of the clavicle shape So i'm

913
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:14.270 
going to push this in over here And we
want to create this hint of a muscle

914
00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:14.970 
below the surface.

915
00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.950 
So i'm creating this crease And i'm

916
00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.730 
smoothing it out again I'm not going to
create a crease and redefine every single

917
00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.310 
muscle since we don't want to bring all
of them out again Keep in mind.

918
00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.850 
We have this layer of fat and skin on top
of these muscles So some of these muscles

919
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.550 
we won't see as clearly defined as others.

920
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.850 
I think something like this will do for

921
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.570 
the neck So this is now a good moment
once again to step back.

922
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:41.010 
Let's have a look at these proportions
We can use the grab brush just to adjust

923
00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:45.850 
some of the proportions of the neck to
fit better to our face so for example I'm

924
00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.350 
gonna widen the neck by quite a bit.

925
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.790 
I want our character to come across as a

926
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.730 
strong character So i'm gonna broaden his
neck by quite a bit.

927
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:57.110 
So i'm gonna raise a bit his trapezius
So we now move the camera to the front view.

928
00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:01.070 
We can already see our character's
looking quite a bit stronger So let's

929
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.590 
broaden his neck a bit more.

930
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.530 
Let's also increase the size of his

931
00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.650 
masseter muscle So this cheek muscle also
makes our character look a lot stronger

932
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:12.570 
So by making these small tweaks with the
grab brush we're starting to bring out

933
00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:17.350 
the personality of our character
So after spending a bit of time tweaking

934
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:21.770 
the face and neck with the grab brush
i've gotten to this result

935
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:25.850 
So within roughly an hour, we've gone
from a uv sphere to this head Now have

936
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.770
